# CSC301, Project Options

## Time Management Tool for Students
#### Android/Web/Console-application

A tool that allows students to conveniently manage their schedule. The main highlight of the product is that it has all lecture and tutorial times, as well as all due dates, in one place.

The main challenge in this project comes from the (very realistic) assumption that instructors will not be cooperative. That is, you cannot count on instructors to create/update due dates. Your system, like most modern systems, should deal with this challenge by letting its users generate and validate the data.

##  Messaging Application for Universities
#### Android/Web/Console-application

A messaging app that allows users to send/receive messages by topic. The idea is to provide students (and perhaps instructors, admin staff, etc.) with a convenient tool to broadcast (and consume) important/relevant information. 

The most basic features are:
 * A user can post messages to specific topic(s). And not to a specific user(s).
 * A user sees messages from all the topics he/she has subscribed for.

Just to give you an idea, here are example of hypothetical topics that could make sense: _1st Year Students_, _CSC301_, _Victoria College Events_, _St. George Traffic and Parking Notifications_, _Roommates Wanted_, etc.


## Online University Portal Module
#### Android/Web/Console-application

-Pending Approval
The previous two project options can be integrated as part of a larger Online University Portal.
If you have another suggestion that is self contained and can be a part of an Online University Portal, and if you believe you can work hard on building that project then you can propose your idea.
