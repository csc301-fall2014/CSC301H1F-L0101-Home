 * Please register for a team by filling in your **GitHub username** in [this shared doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dpJLd1plT22f2bhnHbvw4zMiK4ZZeJnx9Hks4u1H274/edit#gid=0).
 * Up to 6 people per team.
 * Small teams might get merged with other teams.
 * The teams for this exercise, and the teams for the project are different (think of this exercise as a "test run").


That's it for now, later we will create your team repositories that you will use for this exercise.
