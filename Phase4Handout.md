   * Run us through the way your software is built
     * What are its main components? 
     * What are their responsibilities? 
     * How do they interact with one another? 
     * What technologies and tools did you use?
   * Mention interesting technical challenges you faced, and/or interesting software techniques that you used. 
* Demo (~2 minutes)
   * Show the key features in your demo
   * Run through a simple use case
   
Other instructions:
 * Be prepared! Your team should take no longer than 1 minute to setup your presentation and demo 
   * You must prepare your own video output connectors
   * Please test your demo and presentation slides in class beforehand. Make sure your demo fit in the resolution of the projector in class (especially for people who are using the Android emulator)
   * Optional: prepare a backup laptop and video of your demo
   * __NOTE: Your team will lose mark if your team is not prepared__
 * The total time of the presentation (including questions) is __at most 8 minutes__.
   * The time limit is strict.
   * During your presentation, we might ask you a question or two. Make sure you leave some time for that.     
     That is, you should be able to present all of the content in 6 minutes.
 * It is up to you to decide which team member(s) get to present.


### `Phase4/Product.md`

A short report telling us the highlights of your __product__.
 * Max' 500 words.
 * The goals of this report are:
   * Inform potential users of the major product decisions you made:
     * Which features (that weren't a part of [the original handout](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H1F-L0101-Home/blob/master/ProjectOptions.md)) did you choose to focus on?
     * How do you expect a typical user to use your product? (i.e. run us through a quick scenario or two).
   * Give your TA and/or instructor some context, before they see your live presentation.

### `Phase4/Process.md`

A reflection on the software development processes your team ended up using.

 * Max' 500 words.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.
 * If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?     
   In other words, describe an ideal process __for your team__, based on your experience working together.

### `Phase4/Architecture.md`

A report describing the architecture of your program.

 * Max' 500 words.
 * We want to know what are the major components of your system, and how they interact with one another.
 * Feel free to use diagrams.
 * Choose one or two of the most significant architecture decisions you've made, and tell us:
   * What was the reasoning behind these decisions?
   * Do you still think these were good decisions?

### `Phase4/IndividualReports.md`

For this part, each member should write a very short report that answers the following items:

 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

Please keep it short - You should answer each item in 1-3 sentences.

Although these are individual reports, we ask you to submit all the reports in a single file to the team repo.      
Please follow [this template](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H1F-L5101-Home/blob/master/phase4-individual-reports-template.md).
